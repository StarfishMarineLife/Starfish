You shouldn't apply a width: xx% to bootstrap rows and columns.

They have built in width modifiers

div class="col-sm-12" means its a column that only appears on small screens and is the full grid width (grid is divided into 12 columns)

col-sm-x
col-md-x
col-lg-x

small, medium, large screen sizes

1-12 for widths

they can even be offset
